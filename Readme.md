# Pricing Optimization & Profit Uplift Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes and compares a baseline pricing strategy with an optimized pricing strategy to evaluate potential profit uplift while enforcing business guardrails. The goal is to measure financial impact in a realistic, operationally safe way rather than relying on aggressive or impractical price changes.

## Objective
- Quantify profit improvement from optimized pricing
- Ensure pricing decisions respect predefined business rules
- Present results in a stakeholder-friendly, interpretable format

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Total baseline profit
- Total optimized profit
- Profit uplift percentage
- Average price change percentage
- Percentage of pricing decisions blocked by business rules

## Results Summary
- The optimized pricing strategy generated higher total profit compared to the baseline.
- Average price changes remained controlled, indicating a conservative optimization approach.
- A portion of pricing decisions were blocked by guardrails, ensuring compliance with business constraints.
- Overall, the strategy demonstrates a balance between profitability and operational realism.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Translating business problems into measurable metrics
- Evaluating optimization strategies using data
- Applying guardrails to prevent unrealistic or risky decisions
- Communicating results clearly for non-technical stakeholders

## How to View the Analysis
Open the notebook `AIPricingEngine.ipynb` to review the full workflow, including data preparation, profit calculations, optimization logic, and final results.

## Data Availability
The original dataset is not included in this repository due to size and/or privacy considerations. However, the notebook is fully documented and can be run using any similarly structured pricing dataset.
